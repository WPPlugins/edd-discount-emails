## Frequently Asked Questions ##

*How do I use this plugin?*

Once activated, the plugin adds a new setting to the Easy Digital Downloads (EDD) add/edit discount page. You can enter a single email, or a list of emails with each email separated by a comma. When a discount has an email requirement, it will be applied to the cart only when the customer's email address is in the required emails for that specific discount.
